## Functions

### Definition

Function - a construct where one more inputs produce an output, or mapping incoming inputs to a resulting output. 

Taken a bit farther - both input and output values can be thought of as sets of all possible values within that set.

```typescript
// Both incoming and outgoing types are numbers
// This function acts as a mapping that maps a number to a doubled number
// Both values are any number within the set of all numbers
const double = (x: number): number => x*2;
```

This can be any number of parameters that combine to form the output.

### What is a pure function?

A pure function is a function whose return value depends *entirely* on the parameters passed in.

As a corollary, an impure function has *side effects* or it may be utilizing some sort of potentially undependable outside context to perform its task.

As an example, reaching out to a service for data or running log statements would be impure functions as they are not entirely dependent on their input.

---

### Referential transparency

A benefit of function purity is that a function, given a particular set of parameters, will always return the same value. If a value has already been calculated, we can replace any future calls with the result of a previous operation.

Memoization relies on this fact, and relies on the functions being pure.

---

### Empty sets

We do not need to provide input, nor return some output.

A function that takes zero input, and always returns the same value is a *constant* function. Functions that take input, but return no value are probably going to have associated side effects.

Importantly, no inputs and no return value are side-effectful.

---

### First class objects

Functions are first class objects - meaning they can be treated similarily to other data types (assigned to const, passed or returned to function). A function that maps to normal data types are first order functions. Functions that receive or output other functions are higher order functions.

Side note: a predicate function - returns a boolean value.

Common examples are find, reduce, map in JS/TS. The *reduce* function is versatile enough that it can be used to implement any HOC on any function in Array.prototype.

---

### Currying

A common pratice is to take parameters one by one and return a function. This function will take the remaining parameters.

The data that these functions will work with will be the last parameter.

This is an example implementation of `Array.prototype.find` using this concept.

```typescript
// this only takes a predicate, and returns a function
export const find = <T>(pred: Predicate<T>) => 
  (ts: T[]): T | undefined => {
    // The predicate logic is now captured by closure
    return ts.reduce((prev: T | undefined, curr) => {
      if (prev) return prev
      if (pred(curr)) return curr
      return undefined
    }, undefined)
  }
```

This is an example of currying.

```typescript
const result = find<number>(x => x % 2 === 0)([1,2,3,4,5,6]);
```

This is pretty cumbersome to work with - fp-ts has *pipe* and *flow* methods to make this experience better.

```typescript
const result = pipe(
  // pipe's first parameter is our data
  [1,2,3,4,5,6],
  // the second, and subsequent, parameters are functions
  find((x) => x % 2 === 0)
)
```

The type will be inferred properly from our value and function parameters. flow works similarily but does not take an initial data value.
